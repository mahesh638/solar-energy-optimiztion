# solar-energy-optimiztion
This project aims to build a model of a smart solar panel that faces the sun as it moves during the duration of the day. Furthermore, to improve the device by building a Machine Learning model to predict where the panel needs to be facing at different parts of the day to make it usable in any terrain without a sensor. <br/>
