# solar-energy-optimiztion
This project aims to build a model of a smart solar panel that faces the sun as it moves during the duration of the day. Furthermore, to improve the device by building a Machine Learning model to predict where the panel needs to be facing at different parts of the day to make it usable in any terrain without a sensor. <br/>

The flat platform that the panel is placed in has 4 LDR sensors in the corners. Servo motors are used to rotate the panel. The sensors and the motors are connected to an Arduino Uno which is then connected to a Raspberry Pi. Refer Solar tracking Proj.pptx for more details regarding the circuit
